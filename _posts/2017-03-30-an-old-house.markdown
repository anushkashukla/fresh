Holla people!                                                                                                                     
Many of us dream to get IIT,and so do I.After working my ass off for the 2 years i got IIT KGP,economics.Well i was'nt much satisfied with my rank but with time that guilt went off.
For now I feel happy to study something dealing with real world and is very interesting.


well like many others I too had many expectations from the college .Many of those expectations were fulfilled while some were'nt.

I strongly wanted IIT D and all the time i worked it was this college which I aimed,along with it I imagined a good city life,good clothes.well basically I wanted to upgrade myself not just acadimically but in all dimensions,and while coming here  i wondered that this place won't be this backward with such a bad weather but reality was something different.I landed at KGP and I could see nothing other than trees,small houses,poor railway station with many wierd beggars.This place just have IIT and Railways, a small Big bazar and a movie theatre(for name sake).

Even though there were things I could'nt get which I thought of ,there were many good things which this palce taught me.Although it's only been an year or so but I have changed a lot.I could'nt forget to mention my friends who had been very supportive in all odds and never left me alone,partly it's because of them I feel so comfortable at this place.

well this is just the begining,there is lot to come ahead,hope to have wonderful coming years.
